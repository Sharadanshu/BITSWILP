The agent plays as White and must learn how to convert an advantage into a win or at least avoid a loss in a MiniChess game against a defensive opponent. The problem must be modelled as a finite MDP. Register number of first student in a group (alphabetically sorted) will be considered for configuration design.\n","The student will:\n","* Implement a custom Mini Chess environment.\n","* Use dynamic programming to compute the optimal value function and policy.\n","* Analyze how state design and reward shaping affect the learned policy and convergence."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f2a8d3b7","metadata":{"id":"f2a8d3b7"},"source":["### Scenario\n","\n","You are building a “Mini Chess Game” for beginner players.
